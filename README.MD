- **Alerts & Notifications:** Sends alerts for abnormal activity or health issues.
- **Mobile & Web Interface:** Access data and manage settings from any device.

## Technologies Used

- **Hardware:** Microcontroller (ESP32/Arduino), GPS module, sensors (temperature, heart rate).
- **Software:** Embedded C/C++, Python, Node.js, React.
- **Cloud:** Firebase/AWS for data storage and notifications.
- **Mobile App:** React Native for cross-platform support.
